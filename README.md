# Bitbucket dark theme styles

Did you ever wonder why Bitbucket doesn't have a dark theme? ðŸŒ”

Same here, so here's a piece of code that solves the problem... and your eyes!

An extension for injecting CSS on a page such as:
- [Stylebot](https://stylebot.dev/)

## ðŸš€ How to use it

- Copy the content of the `main.css` file.
- Go to [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org).
- Open the extension's code editor.
- Paste the code in the editor (save if necessary).
- Enjoy it!
